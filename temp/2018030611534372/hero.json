    "Sorcery - (Recharge 2+) You can access two powers from your grimoire each turn, but you must follow the normal rules for activating each power.

    "Sorcery - If a power in your grimoire has two Recharge rolls, one for Sorcery and one for the power itself, always use the harder of the two rolls to see if the power returns for use. Any power that also possesses some ability to push or extend its capabil- ities is +1 harder to Recharge with Sorcery.",

You can burrow through or under any intervening terrain as if it were normal ground. You cannot resurface within a solid object. Instead of attacking when you surface, you can create fissures and tremors. Use your special action to create these tremors; any enemies within 5in of you must make a TN3 check or be knocked down.",
